Hello-World repository

I'm Jacob. I use the Unity game engine.
I currently am working solo - doing all of the coding, design, and animation myself.
One thing I do not do is 3D model, so I use either TurboSquid or MakeHuman for this.
I am mostly working with JavaScript as I know it better, but use C# as well - but tend to try not to mix both in one project.
I have over 15+ projects either unfinished or scrapped, and I'm working on finishing one by at least April of 2018.
